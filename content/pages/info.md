      I am a Mechatronics engineer with over three years of hands-on experience
      in CAD, GD\&T, and PLC programming, specializing in the design,
      visualization, and coordinated development of machinery, fixtures, and
      ergonomic workstations using integrated mechatronic systems. My technical
      background is complemented by a rigorous commitment to safety and quality,
      evidenced by my role at Bosch where I led the establishment of new
      machines, developed advanced fixtures, and ensured compliance with robust
      safety protocols across production environments.


      Currently, I am pursuing an MSc in Engineering with Management
      (Intelligent Manufacturing) at the University of Bristol, where I am
      deepening my expertise in strategy, risk management, and organizational
      leadership. This dual focus has empowered me to develop risk mitigation
      frameworks for manufacturing transformations and to bridge the gap between
      innovative engineering and effective business management.


      I am passionate about joining consulting because it allows me to leverage
      both my technical proficiency and strategic mindset to solve
      multidimensional problems for clients. Consulting excites me as it offers
      the chance to engage with complex decision-making processes, understand
      how engineering innovations impact business and financial outcomes, and
      contribute to the development of holistic solutions that deliver
      measurable value. I aspire to be at the forefront of interdisciplinary
      teams, influencing tactical choices and guiding organizations through
      technological change, operational efficiency improvements, and the
      realization of sustainable growth.

          1.  During my tenure as a Graduate Apprentice in the Technical
          Engineering function at Bosch Limited, I was entrusted with the
          optimization of production line processes across multiple technical
          domains, including industrial design, pneumatics, hydraulics,
          machining, industrial cameras, electronics, and 3D modeling. I
          executed and led numerous cross-functional projects, demonstrating a
          strong command of CAD-driven fixture and workstation design,
          generative design principles, and the integration of intelligent
          interlocks and poka-yoke mechanisms to enhance operational efficiency
          and product quality.

          2.  Some of my major contributions include:

              1.  Process Optimization & Automation: Spearheaded the design and implementation of custom clamping systems and pallets for nozzle nut assembly, automating torquing processes to increase consistency, reduce manual labor, and drive productivity gains.

              2.  Prototyping & Additive Manufacturing: Implemented 3D printing for rapid prototyping and manufacturing of components, achieving substantial cost savings and enabling innovative solutions for assembly and testing challenges.

              3.  Fixture & Machine Development: Developed and integrated centrifugal drying systems, redesigned dryer baskets, and engineered automation-focused modifications to improve cycle time and process consistency—reducing drying times by up to 68%.

              4.  Quality Improvement: Utilized technical problem-solving and FMEA to diagnose root causes in assembly processes, leading to solutions such as sensor-based interlock systems that decreased risk and improved product reliability (notably reducing RPN from 108 to 72).

              5.  Industrial Automation: Programmed and deployed Cognex camera vision systems for magnified and digitized code inspection, training operators and enhancing inspection efficiency and quality control.

              6.  Safety & Compliance: Championed process modifications and automation to ensure robust adherence to Bosch’s stringent safety protocols during new machine establishment and daily operations.
          3.  Alongside my technical output, I consistently presented actionable
          project recommendations to senior leadership, collaborated across
          engineering and production teams, and demonstrated innovation in
          leading continuous improvement initiatives. My experience at Bosch
          honed my ability to bridge technical expertise with project management
          and strategic problem-solving, preparing me to add value in
          multidisciplinary industrial and consulting environments.

        subtitle: Jan 2022 - July 2022
        text: >+
          During my internship at Bosch Ltd., I led research and implementation
          projects focused on dry leakage testing for fuel injectors, where I
          designed and developed a dedicated testing workstation using Autodesk
          Inventor. I successfully utilized 3D printing techniques for rapid
          prototyping, which resulted in increased production efficiency and
          significant cost savings in manufacturing. My proactive approach
          enabled me to propose and implement design ideas that streamlined
          research and assembly processes, enhancing overall project outcomes.


          Additionally, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to support
          ongoing projects, applying practical engineering solutions, and
          contributing actively to process improvement efforts. This experience
          provided me with comprehensive exposure to industrial problem-solving,
          machine design, and the practical integration of additive
          manufacturing—all while refining my skills in CAD modeling, PLC
          programming, and teamwork in a dynamic engineering environment.
