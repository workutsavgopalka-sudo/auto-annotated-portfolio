client: University of Bristol
description: >-
  This project combines innovative product development and advanced
  manufacturing solutions. It features a universally adjustable mobile phone
  stand designed through iterative CAD modeling and 3D printing, ensuring
  compatibility, durability, and user comfort. On the industrial side, the team
  tackled steel roller production inefficiencies by simulating and implementing
  Industry 4.0 technologies (IIoT sensors, predictive maintenance, smart
  resource allocation), dramatically boosting efficiency and quality. The result
  is a blueprint for integrating generative design and digital manufacturing to
  deliver both superior consumer products and optimized industrial performance.

This multidisciplinary project blends product design innovation with advanced smart manufacturing principles, comprising two robust case studies:

**Part 1: Customized Universal Mobile Phone Stand (3D Printing and Generative Design)**
The team began with the ambitious goal of designing a mobile phone stand that was universally compatible, ergonomic, and visually appealing. Using an iterative CAD modeling approach, they developed six consecutive prototypes, each improving on mechanical reliability, fit, and user comfort. Key technical innovations included:

*   **Spring-Loaded Universal Gripper:** A mechanism allowing phones of any size to be securely held while exposing all critical ports and buttons.

*   **Screw-Based Orientation Adjustment:** The holder can be rotated and locked at any angle between portrait and landscape, using a friction-based screw with heat-inserted threads for smooth, tool-free adjustment.

*   **3D Printing Optimization:** Parameters like layer height (0.15 mm for high finish), infill pattern (70% triangle), and concentric support structures were finely tuned through successive test prints. Testing included design-for-assembly, print orientation, and support pattern modifications to boost mechanical durability and surface quality.

*   **User Testing and Post-Processing:** After each prototype, tactile feel, screen/port access, and stability were reviewed. Post-processing steps, including sanding, steel brushing, and application-specific design tweaks (such as speaker openings and minimum contact for visibility), led to a market-ready, user-centric product adept at universal application.

**Part 2: Smart Manufacturing Simulation for Steel Roller Production (IIoT & CPS Integration)**
The industrial portion tackled inefficiencies in steel roller manufacturing, where idle resources, breakdowns, and reactive maintenance undermined KPI benchmarks like OEE and dynamic labor utilization. The solution comprised:

*   **Industry 4.0 Infrastructure:** Embedded IIoT sensors (vibration, temperature, pressure, and roughness) across critical points in the line, using real-time networking (MQTT/Ethernet) to unify machine and process data.

*   **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS):** Developing and simulating predictive algorithms that trigger pre-emptive maintenance events and dynamically allocate operators to eliminate bottlenecks.

*   **Simulation Methodology:** Utilized AnyLogic for discrete event and agent-based hybrid simulation, replicating actual process flows, machine downtimes, queue lengths, and dynamic worker allocation. Calibration through real-world process parameters and stochastic breakdown logic reflected actual factory variability.

*   **Key Performance Results:**

    *   Bending machine OEE rose from 18.5 to 50.2, welding from 26.3 to 54.0, grinding from 30.8 to 60.5, and furnace from 50.4 to 76.7.

    *   Predictive maintenance and smart resource management cut unplanned shutdowns, slashed defect rates, and reprioritized operator focus where workloads peaked.

*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Implementation cost (sensors, software, training) was estimated at £15,000–£20,000, with monthly savings of £8,000–£8,500. ROI is realized within less than three months, with ongoing reductions in labor, scrap, and downtime.

**Concluding Insights and Forward View:**
The project's product-design side highlights how generative design, rapid prototyping, and user feedback close the loop between concept and commercial product, while the process side underscores the transformative leverage of smart manufacturing—where connected sensors and real-time data analytics drive both efficiency and quality. Future enhancements recommended by the team include advanced AI-driven predictive models, deepened energy monitoring, extended OEE dashboarding, further user ergonomic enhancements (such as foldable or collapsible stands), and scaling of the Industry 4.0 platform for even broader industrial application.
Overall, the project proves how digital and physical innovations—joined by robust simulation and feedback—advance both consumer goods and manufacturing performance for next-generation industry needs.
