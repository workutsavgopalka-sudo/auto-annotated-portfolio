  It’s hard to imagine that I’ve that I wrote all this code by myself, probably
  because I worked with an entire team :) but they definitely followed my lead
  most of the time.

This dissertation addresses the critical challenge faced by manufacturing Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in navigating digital transformation. While Industry 4.0 technologies promise substantial productivity (+25%) and efficiency (+30%) gains, digital initiatives fail at a staggering 70% rate—SMEs being disproportionately affected due to acute resource constraints. Existing risk management models, from basic SWOT analyses to complex ISO 31000 standards, fail to account for the unique interdependencies and cascading risks inherent in SME digital transformation; for instance, financial limitations amplify cybersecurity vulnerability by up to 40% versus large firms.

**Research Approach and Key Objectives**

The research employed a mixed-methods methodology, gathering survey data from 14 manufacturing practitioners and conducting five in-depth interviews. This enabled a triangulation of perspectives: quantitative evidence mapped risk prioritization patterns and dependency structures, while qualitative data revealed underlying mechanisms such as cultural resistance, strategic inertia, and trade-off dilemmas.

The core research question was: *How can manufacturing SMEs effectively assess and manage risks in digital transformation to ensure long-term sustainability and competitiveness?* Three objectives guided the study:

1.  **Risk Identification and Categorization:** Eight risk dimensions were pinpointed—organizational, operational, technical, financial, business, cybersecurity, supply chain, and societal/environmental. The study also detailed 66 granular sub-risk factors validated by practitioner experience.

2.  **Risk Assessment and Prioritization:** Quantitative analysis established strong correlations between organizational, technical and operational risks, highlighting forced serial focus caused by resource scarcity—a phenomenon that creates blind spots for external threats (especially supply chain disruption).

3.  **Decision-Support and Risk Mitigation Framework:** The “Strategic Digital Transformation Risk Management Framework” (SDTRMF) was developed. Innovatively, it introduced:

    *   **Role-based risk assessment:** Weightings assigned per stakeholder group (owners, managers, engineers, operators, advisors).

    *   **Dependency-aware evaluation:** Mapping of risk propagation and prerequisite sequences to prevent cascading failures.

    *   **Phased implementation:** Stepwise, resource-aligned deployment (foundation, pilot, expansion, full rollout), each with specific metrics (security, ROI, staff retention).

**Key Findings and Insights**

*   *Capability deficit not lack of capital is the main driver of transformation failure.* 85.7% of participants identified strategic and leadership shortcomings as root causes, far outweighing pure financial constraints.

*   *Internal risks (operational, organizational) are prioritized while external risks (supply chain, cybersecurity) are systemically marginalized,* resulting in dangerous vulnerabilities that only surface during crises.

*   *Risks are highly interconnected and self-reinforcing.* Strategic inertia delays implementation, creating technical problems that justify the initial resistance to change a loop that perpetuates failures until broken by external pressure.

*   *Risk management in SMEs is a case of forced serial focus rather than comprehensive, parallel evaluation,* spurred by resource constraints and the “liability of smallness.”

*   *Supply chain risk and cybersecurity are chronically underestimated;* lack of attention to these dimensions exposes SMEs to existential threats, especially during global disruptions.

**Practical Framework and Tools**

The SDTRMF translates research insights into actionable tools for SME leaders:

*   **Assessment templates and dashboards:** Organized evaluation protocols paired with progress tracking metrics.

*   **Dependency maps:** Visual tools to chart technology needs and risk interrelations.

*   **Decision trees:** Phase-gated criteria for advancing digital initiatives, based on objective measurements (not ad-hoc judgement).

*   **Quarterly reviews:** Regular reassessment to keep strategy responsive to emerging risks and results.

**Policy, Practice & Research Implications**

*   *For policy-makers:* Shift interventions from funding facilitation towards capability and leadership development.

*   *For SME leaders:* Prioritize internal capacity-building and actively seek out supply chain/cyber risk blind spots.

*   *For researchers:* Future studies should focus on industry-specific vulnerabilities, expansion of supply chain risk analysis, and tracking long-term transformation outcomes.

This research offers a comprehensive, empirically validated roadmap for manufacturing SMEs to escape the cycle of transformation failure, make informed risk trade-offs, and sustain competitiveness in an era of rapid digital change.
