This engineering project tackled the redesign of electric heater elements to achieve substantial gains in both thermal efficiency and production throughput. The core breakthrough was replacing the traditional Nichrome V alloy heating wire with Molybdenum Disilicide (MoSi₂), a ceramic previously used in high-end industrial applications. MoSi₂’s superior thermal conductivity (64 W/m·K) resulted in an order-of-magnitude faster heat-up time, reaching target temperatures in under 60 seconds—compared to around 600 seconds for old designs—providing much better energy efficiency and consumer utility.

However, leveraging MoSi₂ brought a manufacturing dilemma: standard heater production lines, optimized for rapid assembly of wire-based elements, could not accommodate MoSi₂’s powder metallurgy requirements, which involved multiple-hour sintering and debinding cycles. Simulations revealed an initial 28% drop in production output, risking commercial viability and market position.

The project team responded with an integrated, data-driven approach—combining discrete-event simulation (AnyLogic) and Monte Carlo optimization (Python)—to analyze bottlenecks and guide targeted investment. Rather than overhauling the entire line, extra machines were added only where needed (especially for sintering and debinding), increasing total capacity from 15 to 46 key process stations. The optimized system surpassed the original line’s throughput (1,414 units/week vs. 1,287), justifying both the technological leap and the capital expenditure.

Key performance indicators were:

*   **Heating Efficiency:** Time to reach operating temperature.

*   **Manufacturing Throughput:** Units produced per week.

Further sensitivity analysis revealed that while MoSi₂ is much more efficient, process robustness depends on tight control at critical stages (e.g., sintering). This led to recommendations for dual-line manufacturing—one for premium, fast-heating MoSi₂ heaters and one for cost-sensitive Nichrome models—allowing the business to serve multiple market segments and maximize ROI. The new system provides a blueprint for integrating next-generation materials into established production lines using rigorous simulation and optimization, overcoming the complexities of advanced ceramics with smart, targeted process change. Limitations included the need for pilot-scale physical validation beyond simulations and managing higher capital and quality control demands—factors identified as priorities for future improvement. Overall, the project demonstrates how innovative materials, simulation-driven design, and strategic optimization can together drive both product and business success in manufacturing.
