description: >-
  This project presents an integrated strategy to transform Haikou City’s
  transportation system, addressing chronic congestion, underused public
  transport, and pollution caused by excessive private car usage. By expanding
  and optimizing bus and microbus routes, introducing flat fares, implementing
  adaptive vehicle-to-infrastructure technology, and rapidly scaling electric
  vehicle infrastructure, the plan aims to deliver sustainable, efficient, and
  green mobility. The approach enhances connectivity, reduces emissions, and
  leverages digital platforms to create a seamless, user-friendly urban
  transport experience for residents and visitors alike.

This project analyzes the urgent transportation challenges facing Haikou City, the capital of Hainan Island and a Chinese Free Trade Port. Rapid urbanization, population growth, and surges in tourism have resulted in chronic traffic congestion, pollution, and inefficiencies in the public transport system. The city’s reliance on private cars (86% ownership) is heightened by social status perceptions and economic growth, which contributes not only to traffic jams but also to elevated pollution levels especially in business and residential hotspots.

Public transport, though extensive, is underused; monthly bus ridership plummeted from 11.9 million (2021) to 8.89 million (2022) due to maldistribution of routes, poor last-mile connectivity, and unreliable schedules. Meanwhile, outdated vehicles and a limited charging station network stymie electric vehicle (EV) adoption, despite supportive policies and a growing number of new EVs.

To address these issues, the project proposes a multi-faceted strategy integrating public transport reforms, advanced vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, and accelerated EV infrastructure and policy development:

*   **Public Transport Expansion & Flat Pricing:** Introducing a flat fare for bus, microbus, and shared taxis to improve affordability and promote mode integration. Expansion of over 1,300 buses and microbus services targets overcrowded routes and improves last-mile connections, supported by centralized route planning and real-time tracking.

*   **Adaptive Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Systems:** Deploying adaptive traffic signals prioritizes public transport at intersections, reduces congestion, and manages traffic flows using real-time centralized control. V2I also supports dynamic updates, predictive maintenance, and direct user engagement via mobile platforms.

*   **EV Policy & Charging Infrastructure:** Subsidies and scrapping policies incentivize adoption of small-range EVs, while standardizing parts improves repairability and user trust. Plans call for over 400,000 charging stations and integration with renewable energy, reinforcing Haikou’s green transport ambitions.

*   **Behavioral & Environmental Focus:** Targeted awareness campaigns and incentives encourage a shift away from private cars and taxis, improving air quality and reducing carbon footprint. The city’s economic engine, driven by tourism and manufacturing, stands to gain from streamlined logistics and increased productivity due to reduced congestion.

*   **System Architecture & Technology Integration:** The project includes developing a unified digital platform for booking, ticketing, real-time updates, and navigation. Multi-criteria decision analysis and lifecycle assessment support long-term sustainability, while business models prioritize operational efficiency and new revenue streams from ticketing and EV services.

Ultimately, the project offers a model for sustainable, technology-driven urban transport reform centering Haikou as an exemplar for other fast-growing cities. Integration of public transport, advanced technology, and green incentives promises improved mobility, lower emissions, and enhanced quality of urban life.
