date: '2023-08-10'
client: 'Bosch Limited '
description: >-
  Led the end-to-end implementation of a centrifugal dryer to resolve a major
  production bottleneck, reducing cycle time from 25 to 5 minutes per batch. The
  project addressed substantial safety gaps by engineering and integrating
  custom safety locks, nitrogen pneumatics, and PLC-based automation, ensuring
  the system remained locked until the cycle safely completed. Working closely
  with ergonomics, safety, and planning teams, and customizing the critical
  distance piece, the initiative also stabilized the machine and validated
  improvements through large-batch testing. As a result, the operational Risk
  Priority Number was lowered from 108 to 72, delivering a cost-effective,
  compliant, and operator-friendly solution that significantly enhanced both
  process efficiency and workplace safety.
