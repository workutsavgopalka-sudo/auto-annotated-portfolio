title: 'Centrifugal Dryer - Distance Piece '
date: '2023-08-10'
client: 'Bosch Limited '
description: >-
  Led the end-to-end implementation of a centrifugal dryer to resolve a major
  production bottleneck, reducing cycle time from 25 to 5 minutes per batch. The
  project addressed substantial safety gaps by engineering and integrating
  custom safety locks, nitrogen pneumatics, and PLC-based automation, ensuring
  the system remained locked until the cycle safely completed. Working closely
  with ergonomics, safety, and planning teams, and customizing the critical
  distance piece, the initiative also stabilized the machine and validated
  improvements through large-batch testing. As a result, the operational Risk
  Priority Number was lowered from 108 to 72, delivering a cost-effective,
  compliant, and operator-friendly solution that significantly enhanced both
  process efficiency and workplace safety.

## Project Background

As part of a continuous improvement initiative at \[Company/Plant Name], a persistent bottleneck was identified on the production line: Distance Piece and Diesel Injector body cleaning were performed on a single Dürr Ecoclean machine, resulting in a 25-minute cycle time per batch. This negatively impacted output, utilization, and overall cost efficiency. Recognizing the need for a dedicated, high-throughput solution, a centrifugal dryer was sourced and implemented. What began as a simple installation rapidly evolved into a full-scale engineering and safety transformation.

## The Challenge

While the new centrifugal dryer was cost-effective (₹30,000) and promised to drastically reduce cycle times, it arrived with no built-in safety features, unlike the previous system, presenting a major risk to operators. Additional challenges included a distance piece requiring modification to meet operational needs, a high center of gravity resulting in severe vibration and stability issues, entirely manual processes prone to human error, a high initial Risk Priority Number (RPN) of 108, and the necessity for compliance with ergonomic standards as well as seamless integration with existing workflow and floor layouts.

## Multi-Stage Solution

1.  **Process Mapping & Stakeholder Engagement**
    Project planning incorporated thorough process mapping and collaboration with line managers, planners, technicians, and, critically, ergonomics, safety, and planning teams. This ensured all technical improvements were aligned with user needs, spatial constraints, and regulatory requirements.

2.  **Creative and Lean Engineering**
    Value was maximized under tight budget constraints by utilizing in-plant components wherever possible, most notably through the custom modification of the distance piece and resourceful mechanical retrofits. These actions minimized additional expenditure and demonstrated a commitment to sustainability.

3.  **Custom Safety & Automation Upgrades**
    In response to the lack of pre-existing safety systems, robust safety locks were designed for all operator access points, and nitrogen pneumatics were installed for fail-safe, controlled operations. PLC system integration governed the safety lock, preventing machine access until cycles ended and all motion ceased, effectively eliminating accidental exposures. New standard operating procedures (SOPs) were developed to document and train on these improvements.

4.  **Mechanical Stabilization**
    The dryer’s elevated center of gravity was countered by securely anchoring the machine to the floor with precision bolting and vibration-dampening supports, resolving stability issues and protecting equipment longevity.

5.  **Cross-Functional Review and Buy-In**
    Solutions were formally reviewed and approved by ergonomics, safety, and planning teams, guaranteeing compliance and ensuring smooth operational integration and user training.

6.  **Validation and Training**
    Before full deployment, a rigorous 1,000+ part batch trial was conducted to validate performance, safety, and throughput. Comprehensive operator training sessions reinforced new PLC-driven safety protocols and automation features.

7.  **Continuous Monitoring and Risk Analysis**
    Ongoing monitoring of system performance and collection of operator feedback enabled fine-tuning of controls and rapid response to issues.
